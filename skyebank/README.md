# Skye Bank modelling via POJO

This is an updated readme file for my GitHub bank modelling via POJO.

* User Full Name variable was created
* Account.java class was created
* Card.java class was created
* Constant *enum* files for Account.java and Card.java was created
 
 
 * Please note *Some errors with my Card.java class*. The error is in using the enum dataType to call cardType
 
 
.. Modelling was done for only user section of the program.

More update to follow later.

Thank you.
